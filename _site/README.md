A nice README is a good way to help people engage in the project as well. A project with nice README and screenshots will get the attention of users better since itâ€™s a direct way to explain why this project matters, and why people should use and contribute to the project. Good README should also include enough details to help a new user get started, e.g. how to compile, how to install, and how to start integrating.
